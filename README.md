Apache App 1.0

This app is designed to quickly get you up and running with Apache Server monitoring. 

1. Deploy the App to Logscape.
2. Check the Data Sources Page and ensure that the Apache Data Source points to your Apache installation. If you have it on a different Windows drive, you will need to alter the data source path. 
3. Confirm that your error logs match the apache_Error data type - if not, you may need to amend the type slightly.
