Apache App 1.1

This app is designed to quickly get you up and running with Apache Server monitoring. 

1. Zip up Apache.config and ApacheApp-1.1.bundle into a single .zip file named ApacheApp-1.1
2. Deploy the App to Logscape.
3. Check the Data Sources Page and ensure that the Apache Data Source points to your Apache installation. If you have it on a different Windows drive for example or have installed to a custom location, you will need to alter the data source path. 
4. Confirm that your error logs match the apache_Error data type - if not, you may need to amend the type slightly.
